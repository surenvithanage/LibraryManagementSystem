Save the project to particular directory
If ur using phpstorm as ur IDE open the terminal and type
php artisan serve
But before you do this 
Copy the env file from the main project ask ur leader for it if u done have or else create a new project and get the env
file
Then set the username password and database name
Use mysql
Create the database as well

Once done

type

php artisan migrate 
if u get an error just increase the size of the byte
inside the config there is an app.php file

If ur using cmd
do the samething on it as well but the only difference is that you have to access the directory of the project.


I sent u the video as proof just to confirm that everything is working

I wasnt able to add the header because an error occurs due to the missing files which are available in your main project
Cause with that error you cant run the project

The footer will automatically adjust once the project is connected. I havent added the css file.

OTher than that everything is working. Get help from ur project leader if u end up getting an error. Cause there 
can be some minor errors when running it on ur lap. 

Cheers!!
